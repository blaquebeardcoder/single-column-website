## Requirements
- The goal is to recreate the website below, replacing the personal specifics with your own images.
- Your page should have at least 6 semantic div sections, including a `<header>` and a `<footer>`.
- The header must contain links to those sections.
_Note: You'll need to figure out how to link to id names for this functionality to work._
- At least one of your sections needs to use a background image.
- One of your sections needs to have at least four pictures.
- Use a hexidecimal color code at least once.

## Bonus
- Import and apply a font-family from Google Fonts
- Use positioning to make your header a "fixed header"
- Use the :hover psuedoclass to add visual styles when a user hovers over something
